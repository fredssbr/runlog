# runlog - Keep track of your activities

## Concept

As a runner, I need a way to log my sessions. Most of them are runs, but there are different types based on the plan provided by the coach.
Each plan is a sheet comprising run sessions towards an objective, which can be a race or personal best in a set distance. 
It's also important to know how I felt during key sessions. There are other types of training as well, like core, strength, bike, and so on.

Perhaps, in the future, we might need to get more data from tools like Strava or Garmin, since the I have a training GPS watch to monitor important info.
